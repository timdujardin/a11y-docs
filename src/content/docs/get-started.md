## What is WCAG?

WCAG stands for [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.1).

It is a set of guidelines developed by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) to ensure that web content is accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG provides a framework for making web content more accessible by defining requirements and techniques for various aspects of web accessibility, including visual, auditory, and cognitive disabilities.

The guidelines are organized into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR), each with specific success criteria that must be met to achieve accessibility.
