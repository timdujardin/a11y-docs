description: Provide meaningful text alternatives for video and audio, describing the information it tries to convey.

When you provide captions, transcripts and/or audio descriptions, you allow people to interpret the video content the
way they navigate the web.

:::note[Accessible audio and video]
Since audio and video can contain such different scenarios, I always refer to this checklist to
map the WCAG criteria to the relevant scenario: [Audio and Video | Web Accessibility Checklist](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/audiovideo).

Such as with images and SVGs, a nice advantage here is that the textual content is then also
made available for search indexing, which allows interpretation of the video content and results in improved SEO.

- Captions focus on making audio content accessible through synchronized text
- Transcripts provide non-synchronized text alternatives to audio content
- Audio descriptions make visual content accessible through additional narration

Each serves a distinct accessibility need and may be required in different contexts to ensure full accessibility compliance.

## Captions

Captions are time-synchronized text alternatives for spoken content and important non-speech sounds in video media. They
appear on-screen as the content plays. Explanation: [W3C - Captions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/).

### Purpose

Primarily benefit people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

### Content

Include dialogue, speaker identification, sound effects, and musical cues.

### Types

- Closed captions: Can be turned on/off by the user
- Open captions: Permanently burned into the video

## Transcripts

Transcripts are text documents that provide a written version of audio content without time synchronization.
Explanation: [W3C - Transcripts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/).

### Purpose

Benefit people with hearing disabilities and those who prefer reading to listening.

### Content

Contain all spoken words and relevant non-speech sounds.

### Format

Usually provided as a separate document or expandable text on the same page as the video. Preferable in close proximity to the video.

## Audio Descriptions

Audio descriptions are additional narration tracks that describe important visual information.

- Explanation: [W3C - Transcribing Audio to text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcribing/).
- Example: [Assassin's Creed Valhalla: [Audio Description] Gameplay Overview | Ubisoft [NA]](https://youtu.be/p5S-LBTLFck?si=WF3s4QQsP_Vm8ghW).

### Purpose

Primarily benefit people who are blind or have low vision.

### Content

Describe visual elements that aren't conveyed through dialogue (actions, scene changes, text on screen).

### Timing

Inserted during natural pauses in dialogue or as extended descriptions.
