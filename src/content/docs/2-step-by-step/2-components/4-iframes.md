title: Iframes
description: Embedding content in an accessible way
---

The `<iframe>` HTML element represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.
The most important thing to remember here to is add a title attribute, since no other mechanism is well supported to provide the iframe with an accessible name.

:::note[4.1.2 Name, Role, Value - Level A]
For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<iframe>...</iframe>

<!-- Good -->
<iframe title="My accessible name">...</iframe>
```
