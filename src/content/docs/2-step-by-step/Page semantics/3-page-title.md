Page titles serve as the first piece of information that users encounter when accessing a webpage, whether through visual browsers, screen readers, or other assistive technologies.
It's also 1 of the required criteria for WCAG compliance, which is 2.4.2 Page titled (Level A).

## Screen reader users

Screen reader navigation: For users of screen readers, the page title is often the first element announced when a new page loads. It immediately informs them about the content and context of the page they've just entered.

## Cognitive disabilities

Clear, concise titles help users with cognitive disabilities understand the purpose and content of each page, reducing cognitive load and improving navigation.

## Best practices

### Match the h1 accessible name

Make sure the page title resembles the same content as the `<h1>` element, since both should serve the same purpose.

### Use logical naming

For multi-page websites, consider using a format like `[Page-Specific Title] | [Site Name]` to provide context.

### Update dynamically

For single-page applications or AJAX-heavy sites, ensure that the page title updates to reflect the current content.
