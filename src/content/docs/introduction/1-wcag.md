## What is WCAG?

It is a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that web content is accessible to people with disabilities. WCAG provides a framework for making web content more accessible by defining requirements and techniques for various aspects of web accessibility, including visual, auditory, and cognitive disabilities.

The guidelines are organized into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR), each with specific success criteria that must be met to achieve accessibility.

1. Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
2. Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users
3. Understandable: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable to all users
4. Robust: Content must be robust enough to be reliably interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including
   assistive technologies

Each of these principles is further divided into specific guidelines and success criteria, which provide measurable ways to ensure accessibility.

## Tangible Examples of Accessibility

To illustrate the POUR principles in practice, here are some concrete examples:

1. Perceivable: Non-text content, such as images, should be accompanied by text alternatives.
2. Operable: All content and functionality should be accessible and operable through a keyboard.
3. Understandable: The language of the page must be correctly set to allow proper interpretation by assistive technologies.
4. Robust: Semantic information, including name, role, and value, should be programmatically available to ensure compatibility with various user agents and assistive technologies.

## WCAG Conformance Levels

WCAG defines three levels of conformance:

1. Level A: This is the minimum level of accessibility, addressing the most basic accessibility features.
2. Level AA: This is considered the legal requirement for most regulations and is the target for most organizations.
3. Level AAA: This is the highest level of accessibility, going beyond the standard requirements to provide advanced accessibility features.
