## "Blind people don't use our product"

This myth ignores the diverse range of accessibility needs. Accessibility benefits people with various conditions, including low vision, dyslexia, and temporary or situational disabilities.

## "Why focus on a minority group?"

The global disability market comprises approximately 1.85 billion people, representing a significant economic
opportunity.

See [World Health Organization - Disability](https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability).

## "Accessibility is too expensive"

While there are costs associated with implementing accessibility, the majority of accessibility defects (67%) originate
in the design phase. Integrating accessibility early in the design process can significantly reduce overall costs and
improve user experience for everyone.

Implementing accessibility features early in the design and development process is crucial. It not only reduces costs but also ensures a more inclusive product from the outset. By considering accessibility throughout the development lifecycle, organizations can create products that are usable by the widest possible audience, thereby expanding their market reach and fulfilling their legal and ethical responsibilities.
