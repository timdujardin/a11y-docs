## European legal context

- [Web Accessibility Directive (WAD)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility): This European Union directive mandates that public sector websites and mobile applications comply with accessibility standards. It came into full effect in June 2021.
- [European Accessibility Act
  (EAA)](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en):
  This act extends accessibility requirements to various products and services, including kiosks, audio-visual media
  services, public transport, banking services, and e-commerce. It will be fully effective from June 28, 2025.

  The underlying principle is everything traded in Europe, both services and products, will have to comply with the EAA.

Example of national transposition combined with penalty price range in Germany:

- [Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz (BFSG)](https://www.barrierefreiheit-dienstekonsolidierung.bund.de/Webs/PB/DE/gesetze-und-richtlinien/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz-node.html) in Germany: This "Accessibility Strengthening Act" enforces accessibility standards in Germany. Organizations must comply by June 2025 or face penalties of up to €100,000.
