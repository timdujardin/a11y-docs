## Why is digital accessibility ubiquitous?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="European legislation" icon="open-book">
    The Web Accessibility Directive (2020-2021) and the European Accessibility
    Act (2025) both have a major impact on European states.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expand your audience" icon="setting">
    More than 16% (1 in 6) of the world population has a disability, in Europe
    that's even 25% (1 in 4). A significant potential market share that you are
    currently ignoring.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Social responsibility" icon="puzzle">
    Imagine the positive impact you can have on people with disabilities, it is
    fighting for the fundamental right to participate in (digital) society.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Brand reputation" icon="laptop">
    It's not top of mind with most governments and companies, so you can make a
    positive distinction against competition. Challenge eachother to reach
    digital accessibility excellence!
